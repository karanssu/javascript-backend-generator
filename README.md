## Javascript Backend Generator

### Overview

This repository provides a Python script that automates the setup of a Node.js and Express server project. By running this script, you will generate a complete project structure with a basic API, including essential files and configurations.

### Features

- **Automated Project Setup**: Run the Python script to generate a complete Node.js project with a basic Express server.
- **Basic API**: Includes a sample `/user` endpoint that returns user data.
- **Script Integration**: Automatically sets up `package.json` with necessary scripts for starting the server.

### How to Use

1. **Download the Script**:
   Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. **Install Python** (if not already installed):
   Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

3. **Run the Python Script**:
   Execute the script to generate the project files:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd generated_project
   ```

5. **Install Node.js Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

6. **Start the Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

7. **Access the API**:
   Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:4000/user](http://localhost:4000/user) to view the sample user data.

### Project Structure

- **`server.js`**: Initializes and starts the Express server.
- **`routes/user/users.js`**: Defines the `/user` endpoint.
- **`package.json`**: Contains project metadata, dependencies, and npm scripts.
